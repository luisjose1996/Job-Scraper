### Scraping jobs from Indeed or CV jobs

The module job-scraper.py enables you to web scrape job postings from Indeed.co.uk or CWjobs.co.uk.

Both require the package Beautiful Soup. For CWjobs, the Selenium web driver is also required. These can be installed as follows:

```bash
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install selenium
```

To use this module, import the job_scraper.py file and call the funciton "find_jobs_from()", which takes in several arguments. For an explanation and demonstration of the required arguments, see Demo.ipynb.
